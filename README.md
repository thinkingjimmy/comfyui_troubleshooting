# ComfyUI Troubleshooting Guide 

最近我发现不少朋友开始学习 ComfyUI，但使用的时候，老遇到各种报错，也不知道如何解决。

所以我决定制作一个解决 ComfyUI 报错问题的系列视频。这个 Github 空间是为了更好地让各位反馈问题而存在。

各位可以通过[提交 Issue](https://github.com/thinkingjimmy/comfyui_troubleshooting/issues/new/choose)的方式向我提问。

另外，各位可以在提问前，先通过我搜索 Issue 的方式，看看是不是已经有其他人提问过，并得到了解决方案。

同时为了方便大家查阅，我也会定期将问题汇总，并发布到[这个网站](comfyfaq.com)，各位可以去查看。

Recently, I've noticed that many friends are starting to learn ComfyUI but often encounter various errors and don't know how to resolve them.

Therefore, I decided to create a series of videos about solving ComfyUI error issues. This Github repository exists to better facilitate problem feedback from everyone.

You can ask questions by [submitting an Issue](https://github.com/thinkingjimmy/comfyui_troubleshooting/issues/new/choose).

Additionally, before asking questions, please try searching through existing Issues to see if someone else has already asked and received a solution.

To make it easier for everyone to find information, I will regularly compile the questions and publish them on [this website](comfyfaq.com) for your reference.
