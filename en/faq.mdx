You can submit your questions in the [Issues](https://github.com/thinkingjimmy/comfyui_troubleshooting/issues) section of our Github page. Your questions may be answered by me or other community members.

When submitting questions, please note:

1. **Use the ComfyUI error keyword as the title.**

Avoid pasting the entire error message as the title. For example, in the error shown below, while the message is very long, the key phrase is simply "Value not in list":

</Frame>

2. **Describe the error in detail.**

In the Issue details, include a complete screenshot of the error mentioned above. Describe in detail what actions you took when the error occurred, such as adjusting a parameter to x. Finally, if possible, please include your computer specifications and ComfyUI version information. If you're using someone else's workflow, please attach the workflow file as well. This will help us better solve your problem.

Here's a well-written [Issue template](https://github.com/thinkingjimmy/comfyui_troubleshooting/issues/2) you can refer to.
